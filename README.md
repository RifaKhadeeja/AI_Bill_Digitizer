# 🧾 AI-Powered Handwritten Sales Bill Digitization and Seamless Accounting Integration for MSMEs

## 📘 Abstract
Small retailers and shopkeepers in emerging markets still rely heavily on handwritten sales bills and manually enter purchase invoices into accounting software such as **BUSY** — a process that is slow, error-prone, and inefficient.

This project introduces an **AI-powered mobile and web platform** designed to **digitize handwritten and printed sales bills**, extract structured data using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** and **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**, and **seamlessly integrate** the data with BUSY accounting software.

The system supports **handwriting recognition, abbreviation expansion (e.g., “p oil” → “palm oil”)**, multilingual processing, and a **human-in-the-loop review interface** to ensure high accuracy.  
Ultimately, it helps MSMEs transition toward digital operations without disrupting their existing workflows.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Image capture & upload (mobile/web)
- OCR using EasyOCR/TrOCR/Tesseract
- NLP-based extraction and abbreviation normalization
- Human-in-the-loop review UI
- Export to CSV/XLSX compatible with BUSY
